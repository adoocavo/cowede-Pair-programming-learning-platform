## 0. overview

Since we need someone to work with to improve our collaboration capabilities, we have planned CO:WE:DE, which matches pairs to write code together. Pair programming is one of the agile development methodologies, meaning two developers working together on a single developable PC. Coweed matches pairs to perform pair programming and suggests problems to be solved. For programming learners who are not familiar with development and collaboration, it is expected that Coweed, a pair programming matching website, will be of great help in learning programming.
